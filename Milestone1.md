## Milestone 1

## Audience

Math Wizard is designed for younger kids ages 4-8, or anyone who wants to practice basic math skills on the go. Parents and teachers can also review the kids' performance.

## Scope

Math Wizard will be an Android and iOS app. It will cover math problems from operations to basic algebra. These problems should be challenging but not require the use of pen and paper. The accessibility of the app will be primarily designed for the blind and visually impaired kids. This includes considerations for large text, colorblindess, and user-friendly screen contrasts. It would also consider children who are deaf or hard of hearing by adding haptic feedback.

### Features
 * Game is fully accessible for blind and visually impaired users. Buttons and Images will be labeled so that it is recognizable by screen readers. Sound/haptic feedback will also be included to give additional cues on the current state of the game
 * A "Report" page will be included so that teachers, parents, or friends can see the player's current level and be aware of areas of improvement

## Approach

1. Market Research
    
    The team will go through existing products that are similar to the app. What is missing? What can we build as an edge against     competitors?

2. Contextual Inquiry

    Observe users in how they typically interact with an educational game. Interview potential users and stakeholders to gain         their opinions on the product. The team will look for research papers relating to and supporting accessibility.
  
3. Ideation and Brainstorming

    Generate a rough idea on what the app will look like. Figure out what tools we will be using for the app.
  
4. Prototyping

    Ideas may start on pen and paper but will then be translated to Figma as the user interface design is more solidified. Stakeholders will be notified of the current progress of the game.
  
5. Evaluation
    
    The app will go through testing between the team. Then, ask some input from peers and potential users.

## Stakeholders

* Parents
  * Goals: Use the app as a fun learning tool for sighted or visually impaired child
  * Worries: May not be fully accessible for a child's specific impairment
  * How to involve them: Get some input on what typically is missing in terms of accessibility in an app. Ask the parents what their child needs in order to perform their best.

* Teachers
  * Goals: Use the app to get children more motivated to learn math
  * Worries: The problems may be too easy/too complex for different users
  * How to involve them: Get ideas on specific problems that appear in classroom exercises. Learn what topics students typically have trouble in.

* Investors
  * Goals: Generate income by involving a new group of potential customers
  * Worries: The game may not be appealing enough to warrant downloads
  * How to involve them: Ideas on proper marketing and design concepts that typically go well with a lot of users.
  
* Classmates
  * Goals: Expand knowledge about accessible apps
  * Worries: Upon learning information about accessible design, they might not have the time to modify their projects to be more accessible
  * How to involve them: Discussion board on myCourses
  
Update all the stakeholders regularly on different significant changes in the prototype. This will be done through e-mail and discussion boards.
  
## Group Rules

1. Equal Contribution. Each group member must contribute to the whole project equally. Individual skills will be utilized to progress the work forward.
2. Share Experiences. If a member is unfamiliar with a program or technique, others will give some input on what can be done to improve. All parties should make an effort to learn or become familiar enough to contribute.
3. Communication. All members must participate in group discussions and must be easily approachable and available.
