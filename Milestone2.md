# Milestone 2: Contextual Inquiry

The team started by discussing different contacts that may be relevant to the project, from friends/family to co-workers.

We approached connections from the American Printing House for the Blind and was then referred to a representative from the NYC Department of Education. After some research, we also found out that the New York School for the Blind is only a couple of miles away so we decided to call and ask if some of the teachers would be willing to be interviewed.

In the end, we managed to interview representatives of our stakeholders. We thank the following people for their time and for imparting their knowledge and experience with the group:

* Heather Kennedy-Mackenzie, Technology Project Manager from the American Printing House for the Blind
* Carol Pangrazio, High School Classroom Teacher of the Visually Impaired at the NY School for the Blind
* Julie Zielonka, Teacher of the Visually Impaired at the NY School for the Blind
* Gian Pedulla, Educational Vision Services Supervisor at the NYC Department of Education

After all the interviews were conducted, the team met up to review the notes and parse through new information. We created first person statements and wrote them down on different post it notes. We first grouped them at the most basic levels and worked our way to the top labels

Some of the most important concepts that we have learned through the process are as follows:

* Age range is more inclusive. It goes beyond the projected 4-8yr old target audience. Some teachers have expressed that high school students can sometimes also have trouble learning some basic math concepts. It is also important to note that the concepts included in the app may be expanded to reach higher levelsubject matters like basic algebra
* For younger kids who are blind and visually impaired (B/VI), numbers after 20 are harder to grasp conceptually because they have do not understand real world value as easily compared to those who experience these concepts visually. Sizes of cars, for example, is hard to determine. It is also easier to illustrate 50 oranges compared to having them touch 50 oranges on a table. Therefore, we need to encourage learning these basic math concepts without focusing on visuals
* (B/VI) children also have trouble with using technology itself. They do not have as much motivation to learn a specific kind of technology if they do not understand the value of everything a phone, for example, can do for them. We need to be able to motivate the children to learn and play the app
* Parents are not as involved as originally anticipated because of the learning barrier. It is not as easy to teach/follow a child's progress when parents do not understand some foreign tools themselves (Braille, Nemeth Math)
* Each learning experience vary per individual based on the available technology. They are less likely to be studying in groups but would love to be able to participate in peer activities without a lot of extra support tools

***We must always remember that we are designing a game that is accessible, not an accessible game***
