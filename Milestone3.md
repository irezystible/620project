For the third milestone, we were tasked to create different personas that would correspond to the app's potential user base.

## Primary

We have decided to have two primary users since we are striving to create a fully accessible game. This means that the final prototype should not only be useful for sighted kids but also to those who are blind and visually impaired.

## Secondary

These secondary users are those who may have in interest in using the app, either for themselves or to interact with the primary user of the app.

## Anti-Persona

An anti-persona is the type of user who will have potentially little to no interest in the app.
