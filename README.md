# Math Wizard

Math Wizard is an educational game designed for kids and kids at heart! This game will guide the wizard-in-training through different dungeons and allow them to defeat monsters by answering math questions. 

Even with all the progress in recent game technology, most designers still fail to include or create accessible games for the blind and visually impaired. Our team's goal is to provide children with more options for educational play through a fully-accessible Android/iOS application. Designed for HCIN 620, you will find the development process and the final prototype for Math Wizard in this website!
