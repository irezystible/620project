# Math Wizard

Math Wizard is an educational game designed for kids and kids at heart! This game will guide the wizard-in-training through different dungeons and allow them to defeat monsters by answering math questions. 

Even with all the progress in recent game technology, most designers still fail to include or create accessible games for the blind and visually impaired. Our team's goal is to provide children with more options for educational play through a fully-accessible Android/iOS application. Designed for HCIN 620, you will find the development process and the final prototype for Math Wizard in this website!

## Audience

Math Wizard is designed for younger kids ages 4-8, or anyone who wants to practice basic math skills on the go.

## Scope

Math Wizard will be an Android and iOS app. It will cover math problems from operations to basic algebra. These problems should be challenging but not require the use of pen and paper. The accessibility of the app will be primarily designed for the blind and visually impaired kids. This includes considerations for large text, colorblindess, and user-friendly screen contrasts.

### Features
1. Game is fully accessible. Buttons and Images will be labeled so that it is recognizable by screen readers. Sound/haptic feedback will also be included to give additional cues on the current state of the game
2. A "Report" page will be included so that teachers, parents, or friends can see the player's current level and be aware of areas of improvement

## Approach

The team will go through different iterations of project planning and prototyping for app development. Ideas are first sketched out on paper and translated to one of the major prototyping tools as the UI design gets more solidified. We plan to interview some potential stakeholders as well as users who may be interested in the app.

## Stakeholders
